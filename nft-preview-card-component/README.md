## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project I understood more on how the CSS box model works and also how to use display: flex; to center my design and also help me out in manipulating some design i needed for complete the project

### Continued development

I've not fully grasp how mobile responsiveness works, so i did not do much on this project and also the css pseudocode (active state) I could not implement it on the photo and i will love to learn how that was done, I know my naming and code style is a bit shaky, I trust i will improve when i build more project
 
### Useful resources

- [WebDev](https://www.web.dev) - I want to learn more on responsible design from this website and i hope to get good understanding
