## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project I understood more on how the CSS box model works and also how to use display: flex; to center my design and also help me out in manipulating some design i needed for complete the project

### Continued development

I've not fully grasp how mobile responsiveness works, so i did not do much on this project and also the css pseudocode (active state) I could not implement it on the photo and i will love to learn how that was done, I know my naming and code style is a bit shaky, I trust i will improve when i build more project
 
### Useful resources

- [WebDev](https://www.web.dev) - I want to learn more on responsible design from this website and i hope to get good understanding
